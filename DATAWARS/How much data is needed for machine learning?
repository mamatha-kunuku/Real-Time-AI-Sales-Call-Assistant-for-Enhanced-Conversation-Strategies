How much data is needed for machine learning?
-	depends on several factors, such as type of problem being solved, the complexity of the model, accuracy of the data, and availability of labeled data.
Estimating the amount of data needed can be approached in two ways:
1.	A rule-of-thumb approach:
-	The rule of thumb regarding machine learning is that you need at least ten times as many rows (data points) as there are features (columns) in your dataset. This means that if your dataset has 10 columns (i.e., features), you should have at least 100 rows for optimal results.
-	It involves using heuristics, past experiences, or general guidelines to determine the dataset size. 
-	However, this approach may not account for the complexity of the problem, the nature of the data, or the requirements of the model accurately.
2.	Statistical methods:
-	These methods take into account various factors such as desired statistical power, confidence level, effect size, and variability in the data. 
-	Common statistical methods include power analysis, t-tests, chi-squared tests, â€¦.. 
-	Provides more accurate and precise estimation of the necessary dataset size based on statistical principles.
Choosing the appropriate approach depends on the specific context, the nature of the problem, the available resources, and the level of confidence and accuracy required for the analysis or model.


1) True or False: Having a large dataset guarantees high data quality
a)	True
b)	False

Correct! b


2) True or False: Data quality is a subjective term and does not have a universally agreed-upon definition
a)	False
b)	True

Correct! b
Explanation: Data quality can vary based on context, purpose, and stakeholder perspectives, making it somewhat subjective.


3) Scenario Question
You are working on a project to predict student performance based on various factors such as study hours, attendance, and extracurricular activities. The dataset you have includes information about these features for each student.
In this scenario, what would be an example of a high-quality dataset ?
A. A dataset with accurate and up-to-date information about study hours, attendance, and extracurricular activities for a diverse set of students.
B. A dataset with study hours as the only feature for a small subset of students.
C. A dataset with random and inconsistent entries for study hours, attendance, and extracurricular activities.
D. A dataset with missing values for most of the entries related to study hours, attendance, and extracurricular activities.
Please select the most appropriate option and provide reasoning for your choice.
a)	C
b)	B
c)	D
d)	A
Correct! d
Option A provides accurate and diverse information about study hours, attendance, and extracurricular activities, making it a high-quality dataset for predicting student performance. Options B, C, and D either lack diversity, have inconsistent or random entries, or contain missing values, making them less suitable for predictive modeling in this context.
