3) Scenario Question
You are working on a project to predict student performance based on various factors such as study hours, attendance, and extracurricular activities. The dataset you have includes information about these features for each student.
In this scenario, what would be an example of a high-quality dataset ?
A. A dataset with accurate and up-to-date information about study hours, attendance, and extracurricular activities for a diverse set of students.
B. A dataset with study hours as the only feature for a small subset of students.
C. A dataset with random and inconsistent entries for study hours, attendance, and extracurricular activities.
D. A dataset with missing values for most of the entries related to study hours, attendance, and extracurricular activities.
Please select the most appropriate option and provide reasoning for your choice.
a)	C
b)	B
c)	D
d)	A
Correct! d
Option A provides accurate and diverse information about study hours, attendance, and extracurricular activities, making it a high-quality dataset for predicting student performance. Options B, C, and D either lack diversity, have inconsistent or random entries, or contain missing values, making them less suitable for predictive modeling in this context.
