Hyperparameter tuning -->  Hyperparameter tuning is the process of adjusting the settings of a machine learning model to improve its performance. 
                           These settings, called hyperparameters, are chosen before training and can affect how well the model learns from data. 
                           Tuning helps find the best combination of these settings for more accurate and effective predictions.
                           we will perform hyperparameter tuning to find the best combination of hyperparameters.



1) In the hyperparameter tuning lab, which evaluation metric is used to measure the performance of the logistic regression model?
a. F1-score
b. Accuracy
c. Recall
d. Precision

Correct! - b


2) What is the purpose of hyperparameter tuning in machine learning?
a. To adjust the model's internal parameters during training.
b. To select the best features for the model.
c. To find the best combination of hyperparameters for the model.

Correct! - c


3) What does the plot in final step of the lab indicate?
a. The training accuracy of the logistic regression model.
b. The impact of hyperparameter tuning on the model's computational resources.
c. The relationship between regularization strength and feature importance.
d. The testing accuracy of the logistic regression model.

Correct! - d
